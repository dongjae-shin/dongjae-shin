# Dongjae Shin, Ph. D.üë®‚Äçüéì
I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University (SNU). Feel free to contact me if you have any inquiry for me.

## Interestsüåπ
Atomistic simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) for computational catalysis combined with artificial intelligence (AI)
