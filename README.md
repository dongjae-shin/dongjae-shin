## Dongjae Shin, Ph. D.âœ¨
I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University (SNU). Feel free to contact me if you have any inquiry for me.

### Interests
Atomistic simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) for computational catalysis combined with artificial intelligence (AI)

### Repository overview (under construction)
- **GA4Qsys**: Genetic algorithm (GA) code for structural optimization of supported nanoparticle model in a queueing system
- **SegrDNN**: Code for hyper-parameter tuning of DNN model for surface segregation energy
- **pydrifts3d**: Python-based code to convert experimental DRIFTS data to 3D contour plot
- **Ab_initio_thermo_HgOx:** Ab-initio thermodynamic approach for the stability of SCR catalysts with different VOx structures
- **Bayesian_opt_tutorial**: from-scratch tutorials of BO (for study)
- **MDUI**: From-scratch molecular dynamics (MD) code (C language) and graphic user interface (GUI) (Java) for study
